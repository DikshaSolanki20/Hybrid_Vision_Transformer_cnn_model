# 🚀 Vision Transformer & CNN Fusion

Welcome to the **ViT + CNN Fusion** project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Fusion** to leverage the strengths of both architectures for image classification and other computer vision tasks.

## 📌 Features

✅ **Hybrid Model**: Combines Vision Transformer (ViT) and CNN to capture both local and global features.
✅ **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models for enhanced performance.
✅ **Improved Accuracy**: Achieves better generalization by leveraging multiple architectures.
✅ **Visualization**: Provides insights into model predictions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. The recommended version is **Python 3.8+**.

Install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
_(If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib)_

### 2️⃣ Running the Notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook and run the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook vit+conv_final.ipynb
```
Follow the notebook's step-by-step instructions to train and evaluate the models.

## 📊 Results & Insights
- **ViT captures global dependencies while CNN extracts local features.**
- **Model fusion improves performance over standalone models.**
- **Visualization tools help interpret model decisions.**

## 🤖 Models Used
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
- **CNN (Custom or Pre-trained like ResNet, EfficientNet, etc.)**
- **Hybrid Fusion Model**
